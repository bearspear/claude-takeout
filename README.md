**"Export Current (JSON)"**
- Raw API response with complete data
- Useful for backup or custom processing

### Mega-Zip (Bulk Export)
**"Export All (Mega-Zip)"**

Creates a single archive containing all your conversations:

```
claude-takeout-2026-01-01.zip
├── index.md                         # Master list with links to all conversations
├── conversation_one/

└── ...
```

Each conversation folder has the identical structure to individual ZIP exports.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+M` | Export Current (Markdown) |
| `Alt+E` | Export Embedded |
| `Alt+Z` | Export as Zip |
| `Alt+J` | Export Current (JSON) |
| `Alt+R` | Refresh page |

*Shortcuts work when the popup or sidebar is open*

## Sidebar Mode

The extension can open as a sidebar panel that stays visible while you browse conversations.

### Opening the Sidebar

**One-time:**
- Right-click the extension icon → **Open side panel**

**Make it default:**
1. Click the extension icon to open popup
2. Click the gear icon (Settings)
3. Enable **"Open as sidebar by default"**
4. Now clicking the icon opens the sidebar instead of the popup

### Benefits of Sidebar Mode

- Stays open while navigating between conversations
- No need to re-open for each export
- Wider view on larger screens
- Auto-updates when conversation data changes

## Technical Features

### Branched Conversation Handling
Correctly traces the conversation tree via `current_leaf_message_uuid` to handle regenerated responses - only exports the active conversation branch.

### Artifact Extraction
Automatically extracts artifacts from both `create_file` and `artifacts` tool calls and makes them available in exports. Supports 24+ content types with automatic file extension mapping (e.g., `text/markdown` → `.md`).

### Text Attachments
Extracts pasted text files that have `extracted_content` in the JSON. These are files you pasted or dropped into the conversation. Saved to the `attachments/` folder in ZIP exports with full text content preserved.

*Note: Binary files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.) are saved as `.txt` since only the extracted text content is available in the JSON.*

### Project Support
When exporting conversations from Claude Projects, the extension provides comprehensive project data:

**Filename Prefix**: All exports from project conversations are prefixed with `[Project_Name-project]_` for easy identification:
- `[My_Research-project]_conversation_name.md`
- `[My_Research-project]_conversation_name_claude-chat.zip`

**Project Metadata** (ZIP exports):
- `project/project.json` - Full project metadata from API
- `project/prompt_template.md` - System prompt/instructions extracted as markdown
- `project/docs.json` - Document list metadata

**Project Documents**: Full project files are downloaded via API when available. Falls back to extracting viewed portions from conversation if API fails.
- Full files: `project/filename.md`
- Truncated files (from view tool): `project/filename_truncated.md`

### Uploaded Files (PDFs, Images)
Downloads uploaded files (PDFs, images, etc.) directly from Claude's servers using your session authentication. Saved to the `uploads/` folder in ZIP exports. Includes:
- PDF documents (with page count metadata)
- Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- Other uploaded file types

The extension tries multiple URL patterns when downloading, including constructing URLs from file UUIDs when no direct URL is available.

*Note: The Python companion script can only extract metadata for uploaded files since it doesn't have browser session access.*

### Web Search Sources
Extracts metadata from web search results, including:
- Source title and URL
- Site domain and name
- Citation status (citable, missing)

Sources are grouped by domain in `links_and_sources.md` alongside conversation links.

### Thinking Block Summaries
Uses Claude's actual `summaries` array when available for accurate thinking block descriptions.

### Dynamic Code Fences
Automatically uses ```` (4 backticks) when content contains ``` to prevent nesting issues.

### UTF-8 Encoding & Mojibake Repair
All markdown files include a UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) to ensure browsers correctly interpret encoding when opening files via `file://` URLs.

Additionally, text content is scanned and repaired for mojibake (UTF-8 bytes misinterpreted as Windows-1252). Supports comprehensive character ranges including Greek, Cyrillic, box drawing, mathematical symbols, subscripts/superscripts, and emojis.

### Tool Use Display
Specific formatting for common tools:
- `web_search` - Shows query and formatted results
- `web_fetch` - Shows URL being fetched
- `bash_tool` - Shows truncated command
- `str_replace` - Shows "Edit: filename"
- `view` / `read_file` - Shows "Reading: filename"
- `create_file` - Shows "Creating artifact: filename"
- `artifacts` - Shows "Creating/Updating artifact: title"

### Citation References
When Claude uses web search, citations are converted to linked references with Wikipedia-style back-links:

**In text:** `...text about Hildegard[[1]](#ref-1) and more[[1]](#ref-1)...`

**References:**
```
1. [Hildegard of Bingen](https://wikipedia.org/...) - wikipedia.org [[1]](#cite-1), [[1:1]](#cite-1-1), [[1:2]](#cite-1-2)
2. [Another Source](https://example.com/...) - example.com [[2]](#cite-2), [[2:1]](#cite-2-1)
```

- Each citation in text links to its reference
- Back-links `[[1]], [[1:1]], [[1:2]]` link back to each citation position
- Replaces multiple ↩︎ arrows with numbered clickable links

### Statistics & Metadata
ZIP export includes:
- **Model name** - Parsed to show variant (e.g., "Claude 4.5 Sonnet")
- **Duration** - Time between first and last message
- **Starred status** - Whether conversation is starred
- **Features used** - Web Search, Artifacts, Extended Thinking
- Message counts (prompts, responses)
- Word counts (prompts, responses, total)
- Artifact count
- Text attachment count
- Project file count
- Uploaded file count
- Web search sources count
- Code block count with language breakdown
- URL count grouped by domain
- Timeline (first message, last message, export time)

## How It Works

The extension uses two methods to capture data:

1. **Fetch Interception** - Injects a script that hooks into `window.fetch` to capture API responses as they happen

2. **Direct API Calls** - For bulk export, makes authenticated requests to:
   - `GET /api/organizations/{orgId}/chat_conversations` - List all conversations
   - `GET /api/organizations/{orgId}/chat_conversations/{id}` - Get full conversation

Your existing session cookies are used for authentication (no API keys needed).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `manifest.json` | Extension configuration (Manifest V3) |
| `background.js` | Service worker for sidebar panel behavior |
| `injected.js` | Fetch interceptor (runs in page context) |
| `content.js` | Bridge between page and extension |
| `popup.html` | Extension popup UI |
| `sidepanel.html` | Sidebar panel UI |
| `popup.js` | Export logic and markdown conversion |
| `jszip.min.js` | ZIP generation library |

## Troubleshooting

### "Refresh page to capture data"
The extension needs to intercept API calls. Refresh the Claude page after installing.

### "Navigate to a conversation to export current"
You're on Claude but not viewing a specific conversation. Click into a chat.

### Export buttons disabled
The extension hasn't captured conversation data yet. Try:
1. Refresh the page
2. Navigate to a different conversation and back
3. Check that you're on `claude.ai`

### Bulk export is slow
Each conversation requires a separate API request. A 300ms delay is added between requests to avoid rate limiting. For 100 conversations, expect ~30 seconds.

### Some conversations failed to export
Check the browser console for error details. Common causes:
- Conversation was deleted
- Network timeout
- Rate limiting (try again later)

### ZIP export fails
- Check browser console for specific error
- Try exporting as Markdown first to verify data capture
- Large conversations may take a moment to process

## Privacy & Security

- **No external servers** - All processing happens locally in your browser
- **No API keys stored** - Uses your existing Claude session
- **No data collection** - Nothing is sent anywhere except to your downloads folder
- **Open source** - Full source code visible in extension files

## Technical Documentation

See [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) for a comprehensive technical writeup covering:
- JSON structure and data extraction
- Message chain/tree resolution for branched conversations
- Content block types (text, thinking, tool_use, tool_result)
- Artifact extraction from multiple tool types
- File handling (attachments, uploads, ephemeral blobs, project files)
- Web search sources and citation processing
- API endpoints and authentication

## Companion Script

Works with [claude_json_to_md.py](https://github.com/...) for command-line processing of exported JSON files.
